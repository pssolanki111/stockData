# stockData
A python script to get stock data from `alpha-vantage API`, which plots the data in Candlesticks graphs and updates every one hour automatically. Also adds new data to a `CSV` continuously.

# Features
The program allows you to customize your results with 4 available options. These are:
- Your **API key** (default will be used if left blank)
- symbols' file - a text file containing symbol names. One name per line. All the symbol names will have their own graph plotted.
- Interval - A dropdown with possible options `1min`, `5min`, `15min`, `30min` & `60min`. Indicates duration between two consecutive data points in graph. Default being `30min`.
- Output Size - a dropdown with possible options `compact` & `full`. Compact will get most recent 100 data points whereas full will return all the data available data points. `compact` is default and recpmmended.

# Things to Note

- Each symbol will have its own **candlestick** graph in own sparate window.

- Each graph has two parts. Top one will be standard candlestick graph denoting `OCHL` **(Open-Close-High-Low)** vs **Timestamp** whereas the bottom one will be standard bar graph denoting total **Volume** vs **Timestamp**.

- The Graph once plotted will get updated every hour automatically.

- The information will also be written to a **CSV** file. Duplicate data will be *left out*. Each symbol will have its own separate CSV file. All the CSVs will be saved in the same folder where the script is stored.

- The program uses `multiprocessing` to make the most of resources available and hence resulting in good performance.
